### Caesar for pocket
##### Before starting, Caesar is an AI model, which is combination of pocket part and ligand part. 
In the drug discovery, protein-ligand docking offers significant advantages by reducing both computational costs and time compared to wet lab experiments. 
The entropy changes that occur during binding play a crucial role in protein-ligand interactions, and should be properly considered in computational calculations in order to match experimental outcomes.
To overcome these limitations, we propose the CAESer (Component Analysis of Entropy from Static structures) model.
The majority of current docking scoring functions lacks or inadequately account for the entropy considerations. 
The network applies deep learning techniques to estimate various entropic components associated with a binding event directly from a static snapshot structure, avoiding huge computational cost required  for conformational sampling.
